No, you do not need to include

setuptools

 in your

requirements.txt

 file. The

requirements.txt

 file is used to specify the dependencies that are required to run your project, whereas

setuptools

 is a build tool used to package and distribute your project.

However, you will need

setuptools

 installed in your environment to create the distribution packages. This is typically done using `pip` before running the packaging commands.

Here is the updated

requirements.txt

 file, which should only include the runtime dependencies:

```txt
python-telegram-bot>=20.7
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
pyyaml>=6.0.1
```

### Steps to Create Distribution Packages

1. **Ensure you have

setuptools

 and `wheel` installed**:

```sh
   pip install setuptools wheel
```

2. **Create the distribution files**:

   ```sh
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   ```
3. **Upload to PyPI** (if needed):

   ```sh
   pip install twine
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

These steps will help you package and distribute your project without needing to include

setuptools

 in your

requirements.txt

 file.
