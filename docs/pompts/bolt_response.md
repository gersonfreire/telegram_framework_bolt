please create an entire python framework to build telegram bots that offers embedded basic commands described in this bot_usage.md file uploaded here plus users management, payment and balance management for this users and settings management. You must implement a python super class which inherits from  base classes of python-telebra-bot library. This framework must implement by default the embeded bot persistence which sotres all state of the bot that will be autmatically reloaded at bot start, included bot users data as each user name, id and balance. All embeded commands must be automatically inherited when the programmer creates a script from this framework, as simple as instantiting the main class like this single line of code: bot = MyTelegramFramework().

I'll help you create a comprehensive Python framework for Telegram bots with all the requested functionality. I'll break this down into multiple focused modules for better organization and maintainability.

Comprehensive Telegram Bot Framework

* Create initial files
* Update

  `package.json`

* Install dependencies

```
  npm install
```

* Create

  `requirements.txt`

* Create

  `src/framework/base.py`

* Create

  `src/framework/persistence.py`

* Create

  `src/framework/user_management.py`

* Create

  `src/framework/payment_management.py`

* Create

  `src/framework/settings_management.py`

* Create

  `src/framework/commands.py`

* Create

  `src/main.py`

* Create

  `.env.example`

* Create

  `README.md`

* Start application

```
  npm start
```

I've created a comprehensive Telegram bot framework that implements all the requested functionality. The framework is organized into several modules:

1. `base.py`: The main framework class that ties everything together
2. `persistence.py`: Handles state persistence using SQLite
3. `user_management.py`: Manages users and their data
4. `payment_management.py`: Handles user balances and transactions
5. `settings_management.py`: Manages bot and user settings
6. `commands.py`: Implements the command registry and default commands

To use the framework, you would simply:

1. Install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your bot token and admin IDs
3. Create your bot with a single line:

```
from framework.base import TelegramBotFramework

bot = TelegramBotFramework(token="your_bot_token", admin_ids=[your_admin_id])
bot.run()
```

The framework includes:

* All commands from the bot_usage.md file
* Persistent storage for bot state and user data
* User management with admin support
* Payment and balance management
* Settings management
* Comprehensive error handling
* Type hints and documentation

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
