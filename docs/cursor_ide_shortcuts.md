I notice you're likely using Cursor IDE, which is actually built on top of VS Code! This makes it very straightforward to import your VS Code keybindings.

Here's how to do it:

1. **First, export your keybindings from VS Code** (if you haven't already):

   - In VS Code, press `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+K Cmd+S` on Mac)
   - Click the three dots (...) in the top right
   - Select "Export Keyboard Shortcuts"
   - Save the `keybindings.json` file
2. **Import into Curs	or**:

   - Open Cursor
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the command palette
   - Type "Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"
   - Copy the contents from your VS Code `keybindings.json` file
   - Paste them into Cursor's keybindings JSON file
   - Save the file

Alternatively, you can directly copy the keybindings file:

- Windows: Copy your `keybindings.json` to `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\`
- Mac: Copy to `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/`
- Linux: Copy to `~/.config/Cursor/User/`

Note: Since Cursor is built on VS Code, most VS Code keybindings should work out of the box without any additional configuration. You only need to import custom keybindings that you've personally modified.
